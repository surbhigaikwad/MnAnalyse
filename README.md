In the MnAnalyse Case Study Competition (August 2024) by the Finance and Economics Club of IIT Guwahati, I conducted a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis on WhatsApp’s $19 billion valuation during Meta's 2014 acquisition. The analysis projected WhatsApp’s future cash flows, factoring in user growth, engagement, and potential monetization strategies such as advertising and subscriptions, and discounted these using Meta’s cost of capital to assess intrinsic value.

The study also explored the strategic rationale behind the acquisition. Meta valued WhatsApp’s extensive user base for bolstering its presence in the messaging sector and tapping into emerging markets. By integrating WhatsApp with Facebook and Instagram, Meta aimed to enhance its ecosystem and mitigate competitive threats. The analysis underscored how strategic benefits, such as user base expansion and long-term integration, justified the high valuation despite WhatsApp’s minimal direct revenue at that time.
